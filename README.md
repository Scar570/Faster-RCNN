# Faster-RCNN Object Detection
## Objective
#### This project demonstrates the implementation of Faster RCNN for object detection using PyTorch. Faster RCNN is a powerful and popular object detection algorithm that combines Region Proposal Networks (RPN) with Fast RCNN detection networks to achieve high-performance detecting objects within images.
## Prerequisites
#### Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.0+
* torchvision
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* OpenCV (for image processing)
* scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
## Dataset
#### This implementation can be used with any object detection dataset formatted in COCO or VOC style. You can use the COCO or any custom dataset for demonstration purposes.
